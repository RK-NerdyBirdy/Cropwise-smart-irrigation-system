# Cropwise-smart-irrigation-system
This project implements a Smart Irrigation System using an XGBoost model to predict whether irrigation is required based on crop type, soil conditions, and real-time weather data. The system integrates IP-based geolocation, weather forecasting, and hydrological calculations (runoff, slope) to make intelligent irrigation decisions.
